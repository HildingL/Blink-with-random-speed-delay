# Blink-with-random-speed/delay
The purpos of this program is to test out hackclubs's highseas.

This is a rely simple arduino blink program, modified to blink att a random speed between 50 and 500 milliseconds for two blinks, it then generatets a new random time and blinks at that speed for another two times, it generatets a new random time and blinks at that speed for another two times.... yea i think you get the idea.

The program uses pin 13, the pin for the builtin led on the arduino uno.
